# Neural Networks with Brain.js

Motivated to deepen my understanding of neural networks in the JavaScript ecosystem, I embarked on the Neural Networks course with `brain.js` offered by Scrimba. Throughout the course, I engaged in writing these exercise files, exploring various ideas and concepts in practical applications.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phillippelevidad/neural-nets-with-brain-js
cd neural-nets-with-brain-js
npm install
```

## Usage

Each script in the src folder represents a different exercise or application of neural networks. To run an exercise, use the following command:

```bash
node src/{file-name}.js
```

Replace `{file-name}` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute. Examine the source code of each exercise to learn more.

## Exercises and Applications

The `src` folder contains a variety of exercises, each demonstrating a unique application of neural networks:

- **Simple XOR Training (01-simple-training-xor.js)**: Demonstrates the basics of neural network training using the XOR logic gate as an example.
- **Sequence Number Training (02-simple-training-seq-nums.js)**: Focuses on training a neural network to recognize and predict sequences of numbers.
- **Color Classification (03-colors.js)**: An exercise in training a neural network to classify colors, which could be extended to more complex image processing tasks.
- **Restaurant Rating Prediction (04-restaurants.js)**: Uses neural networks to predict restaurant ratings based on various factors, showcasing the use of neural networks in decision-making processes.
- **Task Estimation (05-estimate-tasks.js)**: Demonstrates how neural networks can be used for estimating task durations or other quantifiable outputs in project management.
- **Counting with Neural Networks (07-count.js)**: An application of neural networks in counting objects or values, potentially useful in data analysis.
- **Normalization in Stock Market Data (08-normalization-stock-market.js)**: Focuses on the importance of data normalization in neural networks, particularly in the context of stock market data.
- **Predicting Multiple Steps (09-predicting-multiple-steps.js)**: Explores the capability of neural networks to make multi-step predictions, a valuable aspect in time series analysis and forecasting.
- **Learning Mathematics (10-learning-math.js)**: Illustrates how neural networks can be trained to solve or assist in mathematical problems.
- **Number Detection from Images (11-detect-numbers-from-images.js)**: Applies neural networks to the field of image processing, particularly in detecting numbers from images.
- **Neural Network as a Book Writer (12-book-writer.js)**: A creative exercise in text generation, where a neural network is trained to write text or potentially author a book.
- **Sentiment Analysis (13-sentiment-analysis.js)**: Uses neural networks for analyzing sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) in text, a common application in natural language processing.
- **Task Estimation - Advanced (14-estimate-tasks-comeback.js)**: An advanced version of the task estimation exercise, potentially incorporating more complex features or data sets.
- **Wine Tasting Neural Network (15-wine-tasting.js)**: Accompanied by a dataset (15-wine-tasting.csv) and configuration (15-wine-tasting.json), this script explores the use of neural networks in classifying or predicting wine preferences and characteristics.
